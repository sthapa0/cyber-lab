#Cyber Lab - Sangam S. Thapa

This repo will be where I document my cybersecurity projects, home lab setups, and experiments.
My goal with this is to learn both offensive and defensive sides of security.
I'm basically going to learn how to attack and defend within my own lab.

##Lab Overview
I'm building a small home lab that will initially help me learn real-world secruity concepts such as:
- **Kali Linux** - for attacking
- **Windows/Linux Targets** - to test for expliots and try to defend them.
- *Planning on adding more tools as I learn more*

##Projects planned
- Making a small virtual test lab using **Kali + Windows**
- Learning **Wireshark** and **Nmap** for network scanning

##Tools and Skills I plan to learn/ learning
- Linux CLI
- Networking Fundamentals
- Nmap, Wireshark and firewall rules
- Python

##Notes (coming soon)
I'll be using this repo to jot down anythings interesting I come across when conducting projects or learning tools.

##Goals
- Expand my homelab into a small company enabling me to run multiple tests at once.
- Practice both Red and Blue team skills
- Build confidence in detecting and preventing attacks.
- Document **EVERYTHING** I learn over time.
